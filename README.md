# Smart_Parcel_Box_Notification_System
The Smart Parcel Box Notification System is an IoT-enabled solution designed to securely receive parcels and instantly notify the user upon delivery. It leverages a Raspberry Pi as the central controller, integrated with sensors, a buzzer, and LED indicators to provide real-time alerts.
🔧 Key Components
- Raspberry Pi: Acts as the brain of the system, handling sensor inputs and controlling outputs.
- Sensors (e.g., IR or weight sensors): Detect when a parcel is placed inside the box.
- LED: Provides a visual indication of parcel arrival (e.g., glowing green when a package is detected).
- Buzzer: Emits an audible alert to immediately notify the user.
- IoT Connectivity (Wi-Fi/Cloud): Sends notifications to the user’s smartphone or web dashboard for remote monitoring.
⚙️ Working Principle
- When a delivery person places a parcel inside the box, the sensor detects the presence.
- The Raspberry Pi processes this input and triggers both the LED and buzzer.
- Simultaneously, the system pushes a notification to the user via IoT (e.g., mobile app or email).
- The user is instantly informed, ensuring timely retrieval and reducing risks of theft or missed deliveries.
🌟 Features
- Real-time alerts: Immediate buzzer sound and LED glow upon parcel arrival.
- Remote monitoring: IoT-based notifications accessible from anywhere.
- Security enhancement: Prevents unattended parcels from being lost or stolen.
- Scalable design: Can be extended with cameras, smart locks, or QR verification for advanced security.
